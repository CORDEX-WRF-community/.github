# CORDEX WRF community

This is a community of researchers using the [Weather Research & Forecasting (WRF)](https://github.com/wrf-model/WRF) modelling system as a regional climate model (RCM), especially in the context of the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling experiment ([CORDEX](https://cordex.org)).

We keep configuration files for the different CORDEX initiatives, along with forks of the official [WPS](https://github.com/CORDEX-WRF-community/WPS), [WRF](https://github.com/CORDEX-WRF-community/WRF) and [NoahMP](https://github.com/CORDEX-WRF-community/noahmp) repositories.
We tag code versions with an additional number (e.g. [v4.5.1.2](https://github.com/CORDEX-WRF-community/WRF/releases/tag/v4.5.1.2)), indicating our modifications with respect to an official release (e.g. v4.5.1), which might include bugfixes not yet included in the official release or new features used by some CORDEX initiatives.
