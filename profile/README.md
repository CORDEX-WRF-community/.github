# CORDEX WRF community

This is a community of researchers using the [Weather Research & Forecasting (WRF)](https://github.com/wrf-model/WRF) modelling system as a regional climate model (RCM), especially in the context of the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling experiment ([CORDEX](https://cordex.org)).

We keep configuration files for the different CORDEX initiatives, along with forks of the official [WPS](https://github.com/CORDEX-WRF-community/WPS), [WRF](https://github.com/CORDEX-WRF-community/WRF) and [NoahMP](https://github.com/CORDEX-WRF-community/noahmp) repositories.
CORDEX-WRF-Community (CWC) WRF versions are tagged with an additional number (e.g. [v4.5.1.6](https://github.com/CORDEX-WRF-community/WRF/releases/tag/v4.5.1.6)), indicating our modifications with respect to an official release (e.g. v4.5.1), which might include bugfixes not yet included in the official release or new features used by some CORDEX initiatives.
Discussion occurs as issues in the specific repositories for the different initiatives.
WRF development is done via pull requests to the next CWC WRF development branch (currently **v4.5.1.7-devel**).
The latest CWC WRF release (currently **v4.5.1.6**) is always found in branch **v4.5.1-cwc**, or the corresponding base version.
Releases are issued for specific purposes; e.g. when a new experiment is started for a given CORDEX initiative.
Check out the repository of the corresponding initiative to find out which model version to use for each experiment and the specific configuration files (namelists, TBL files, etc).
